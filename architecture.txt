# Problem Statement  
Students often struggle to access specific chapters from their syllabus and find comprehensive explanations for their coursework. Traditional methods of studying can be time-consuming and inefficient, leading to gaps in understanding. This project aims to address this challenge by developing an AI-powered web application that allows students to retrieve syllabus chapters and receive detailed explanations through an interactive interface. By using speech recognition, AI-generated responses, and animated text visualization, the system enhances the learning experience, making it more engaging and accessible. Additionally, the ability to record and review interactions ensures that students can revisit explanations as needed.

# Solution Statement  
This project provides an AI-powered web application designed to streamline the process of accessing educational content. By integrating speech recognition, AI-generated explanations, and text animations, the system enables students to effortlessly retrieve syllabus chapters and receive in-depth insights in an interactive manner. The platform converts spoken queries into AI-driven responses, which are then displayed as scrolling text and narrated using text-to-speech technology. Furthermore, the ability to record and save interactions ensures that students can revisit explanations at their convenience. The recorded videos are uploaded to a YouTube channel for future reference, allowing easy access and sharing of learning materials. This approach enhances accessibility, engagement, and efficiency in learning by offering a modern, interactive alternative to traditional study methods.

# Project Architecture & Flow  

## High-Level Overview  
This project is an AI-powered web application that enables voice-based interaction with an assistant.  
- User speaks → AI responds → Text animates → Video records → AI replies continue.

# Core Functional Flow  
### Step 1: User Input (Speech Recognition)  
- User speaks into the microphone.  
- Web Speech API converts speech to text input.  

### Step 2: AI Processing  
- The text input is sent to the Mistral API.  
- Mistral API generates a human-like response based on user queries.  

### Step 3: Dynamic Visual & Audio Response  
- Text Animation: AI response is displayed as scrolling text on a canvas.  
- Text-to-Speech: The response is spoken aloud for a more immersive experience.  

### Step 4: Video Generation  
- The MediaRecorder API records the canvas animation and AI-generated voice.  
- The recorded video is saved for future playback and uploaded to a YouTube channel for easy reference.  

### Step 5: Deployment Pipeline  
- Code is pushed to GitHub.  
- GitHub Actions triggers the deployment.
